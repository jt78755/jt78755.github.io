  <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Tzeng and I am a sophomore at the University of
  Georgia. I recently transferred from Georgia State University, located
  in the middle of Atlanta. I am a finance major, but I still don't know what I
  want to do with this degree. You can find out more about my
  <a href="activities.html">life</a> after I transferred here and what
  <a href="class.html">classes</a> I am taking this semester! On the right is a
  picture that my friend took of me during our Spring Break at Disney World.
  </p>

  <p>Before I transferred here, I was a little skeptical about how different the
    environment would be--moving from a city-based campus to a college town campus.
    I was excited about catching up with many friends from my high school.
    I was introduced to many new friends via my high school friends and with the
    help of them and my new roommates, I was able to adapt quickly.</p>

  <p>My roommate, Gabby, showed me where all my classes were the day after I moved
    in. My other roommate, Akshara, dragged me almost every where with her in hopes
    of our friendship blossoming. The three of us often go out to eat snacks or lunch
    in downtown Athens. My past roommates at Georgia State University were not the
    best, but here at UGA, I feel like I have made many life-long friendships.
    I am making the most of my semester here by joining organizations and clubs
    such as UGA Miracle, Relay for Life, and UGA Swim Club. Also, UGA has an amazing
    program where you can train future guide dogs so I get to see more animals
    around here than I did at Georgia State.</p>
